This study explores the ability of ARIMA models to forecast the prices of Nepali bonds and treasury bills, particularly those experiencing an initial upward trend. 
Analyzing NRB data from 2012-2022, the research aims to quantify this trend, capture seasonal patterns and autocorrelations using ACF and PACF analysis,
and compare the effectiveness of chosen ARIMA models against alternatives in predicting future price movements. By delving into this specific market dynamic, 
the study seeks to enhance understanding and forecasting accuracy within the Nepalese financial landscape.
